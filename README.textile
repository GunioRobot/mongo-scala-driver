h1. Scala wrapper for MongoDB

mongo-scala-driver is a thin wrapper around "mongo-java-driver":http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Java+Language+Center to make working with "MongoDB":http://www.mongodb.org/ more Scala-like.

h2. Important changes

h3. Version 0.7

The major goal of 0.7 is to cover whole set of MongoDB's document data types. The release introduces arrays and references as well as consistent architecture to combine Mongo data types along with Scala models to represent:

* complex objects inside a document
* references to objects inside a document
* optional simple values inside a document
* optional complex objects inside a document
* arrays of simple values inside a document
* arrays of references inside a document

All these changes required a major refactoring of Shape/Field code which led to a number of breaking changes. The following list summarizes most important incompatible changes.
